### Viewing Results

After running tests, you can:

1. **Check the notification service logs** to see delivery details
2. **Use the API** to retrieve the created notifications:
   ```bash
   # Get notifications for the test user
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
        "https://notifications-v845.onrender.com/api/notifications?userId=user_4743276c8677b833ce78fc97772c4256"
   ```

### Customizing Tests

You can modify the test data in `dating-notifications-example.js`:

- Change user IDs in the test functions
- Modify notification content and metadata
- Add new test scenarios
- Test different channel configurations (push, email, websocket)

### Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in your environment:
```bash
NOTIFICATION_SERVICE_URL=https://notifications-v845.onrender.com
SYSTEM_API_KEY=319f4d26e31c1a4c0b44e2a8dff8b2e8c83136557af36f9260c75ea3ca9164e8
```

### Troubleshooting

If tests fail:

1. **Check network connectivity** to the notification service
2. **Verify API key** is correct in the environment
3. **Check service health**:
   ```bash
   curl https://notifications-v845.onrender.com/health
   ```
4. **Review error messages** in the console output

### Integration with Your App

To use this in your actual dating app:

1. **Copy the `DatingNotificationService` class** to your codebase
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install axios
   ```
3. **Set environment variables** for your service
4. **Import and use** the service in your business logic:
   ```javascript
   const DatingNotificationService = require('./path/to/dating-notifications');
   const notifications = new DatingNotificationService();
   
   // Send a like notification
   await notifications.sendLikeNotification(userId, likerInfo, likeContext);
   ```

The test examples show you exactly how to structure the data for each notification type with comprehensive metadata that provides rich context for users and analytics.
